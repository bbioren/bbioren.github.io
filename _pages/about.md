Hi! I am a sophmore planning on studying math and cs at the University of Washington. I am passionate about making
abstract concepts more accesable to people of all backgrounds. My research focus lies in developing methods to perserve the meaning behind text while simplifying its delivery. In my free time I enjoy getting outdoors through bike riding and soccer.

I would love to talk to anyone with similar interests to that of my own, or others that have unique ideas. My email is here: `bbioren@uw.edu`.
